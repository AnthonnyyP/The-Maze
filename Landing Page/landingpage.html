  <h2 class ="backstory">Backstory</h2>
  <p class="backstory_p">As the war between humans and AI raged on, the crewmates of space ship "S.U.S. 152018" set out on a mission to an above earth base to do further recon on whether or not it was safe and logical for further colonization in case the war did not go in the humans' favor. 
  <br>
  <br>
  However, an AI has made it onto the ship, but the crewmates know exactly who it is -- YOU! 
  </p>

  <h2 class="directions">Directions</h2>
  <p class="directions_p">Your mission to spy on the humans is an utter failure, but you've got to make it back with what little information you have. Head for the escape vent!</p>
