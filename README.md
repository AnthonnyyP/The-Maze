### **_Description_**:

A simple maze style game themed after the popular popular game of betrayal and trickery -- Among Us. The player begins at a certain start point and must work their way through the maze to find the exit point. 

Definite possibility that there could be a timer of some sort to increase the level of difficult in the game.

It will be coded using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.
